# Weather App

A simple and interactive weather application that allows users to search for real-time weather information for any city around the world.
The website features a reactive and motion display of colors and allows users to switch between dark mode and light mode.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for any city to get real-time weather information.
- **Weather Data**: Displays current weather conditions, temperature, and time
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can switch between dark mode and light mode. Dark mode toggle with customizable colors
- **Animated Footer**: The footer displays a custom message with a rainbow transparent background, and the text color changes dynamically.
- **Dynamic background based on weather conditions** (planned)

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the website, including responsive design, dark mode, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic fetching of weather data and user interactions.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: A weather API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools that allow for the retrieval of weather data from various sources. It acts as an intermediary, enabling software applications to access real-time, forecasted, and historical weather information.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet containing styles for the website, including dark mode, animations, and responsive design.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles fetching data from APIs and updating the UI based on user input.
